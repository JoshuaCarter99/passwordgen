# <Password Generator>

## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was looking into every nook and cranny to see how much functionality could apply to one seemingly simple program.
- I built this project to obtain experience in implementing JavaScript functions in real life scenarios.
- The problem solved within the challenge was matching up the HTML to the Javascript functions and getting those functions to interact with HTML in real time.
- I learned how to implement my JavaScript code into my HTML code so that one compliments the other with functionality.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

1. Created repository on GitHub.com and cloned repository locally to desktop.
2. Chipped away at all the JavaScript functions to ensure a password could be randomly generated using Char Code formulas.
3. Organized HTML script according to my Javascript code.
4. Fixed CSS to best of my ability so the functionality could be displayed.
5. Finalized with git commit, git push, and deployed on GitHub.com.


## Usage

Open the designated URL, click on the labeled checkmark boxes to decide what criteria will fit into the password you need, and then hit generate password and randomly generated password will be displayed in box.
